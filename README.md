# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Version

This is a web-based implementation of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock". It is built using React.js, HTML, and SCSS. The project is set up with Vite and React, allowing for efficient development and hot module replacement. You can view the live preview of the game [here](https://aesthetic-naiad-ba687e.netlify.app/).

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js (version v18.13.0)
- npm (Node Package Manager, version 8.19.3)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd rock-scissor
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will launch the development server and open the game in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger hot module replacement and update the game in real-time.

## Build

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory with optimized and minified files ready for deployment.

## Deployment

To deploy the project, you can use any hosting platform of your choice. One option is to use Netlify:

1. Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (if you don't have one already).

2. Connect your project repository to Netlify.

3. Set the build command to:

```
npm run build
```

4. Set the publish directory to:

```
dist
```

5. Click on the "Deploy" button.

Netlify will automatically build and deploy your project whenever you push changes to the repository.
